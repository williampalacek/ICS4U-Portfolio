            The AP/College Computer Science Principles course taught me how
            interconnected our life is with algorithms or a set of instructions.
            Along with various intricate subjects such as digital information,
            the Internet, cybersecurity, programming, algorithms, simulations,
            and data analysis. Furthermore, it taught me how to read code no
            matter the language used and fully understand the output and what is
            occurring behind the scenes. This, combined with using Rubik's
            cubes, assisted, and improved my knowledge in assessing code and
            algorithms more logically. And as you can see above, I was able to
            achieve a %100 in the final unit test.

            The Natural Simulations module on Khan Academy showed me how
            computer science is significantly connected to math and that, with
            slight modifications, it can mimic nature. Previous to this module,
            I coded in a majoritively logic and object-based manner. I found
            this module incredibly interesting as it demonstrated the randomness
            in our everyday lives and how to project that into code. With this I
            now understand the crossroads between logic and math and how an
            algorithm uses the two to accomplish something. I will continue to
            use this combination of concepts in my learning going forward, in
            both mathematics and sciences.
